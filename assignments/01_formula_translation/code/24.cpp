// Note: This problem this exactly the same as Question # 9. The same code has been produced here.

	cout << "Please enter the coordinates of Point-1 \n( input format: x y ): ";

	// Now take the coordinates of the second point and assign them to our variables
	cout << "\nPlease enter the coordinates of Point-2 \n( input format: x y ): ";
