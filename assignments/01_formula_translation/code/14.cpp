	// Note: This program requires that we let the user enter all three sides of the triange.
	// This means that a user could enter three sides that cannot form a triangle. The Heron's formula
	// will fail in those situations. I would have liked to employ checks and balances to first ensure that 
	// the values entered by the user do indeed form a triange. This can be done by using Pythagoras Theorem
	// and bunch of if statements. The rules of this assignment prevent me from using if statements therefore
	// I cannot implement those checks here.
